This repository contains the source code for my personal website for teaching physics. The website is built using Node.js and the Express framework. The website is hosted on Heroku (TBD) and uses a MongoDB database. The website is built using the EJS templating engine.

**(NOTE: This website is still under development. It is not yet ready for production!)**
